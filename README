Quine-McClusKey Algorithm

Script Language:
Ruby (Version >= 1.9.1)

Function:
Generate the simplest form of a logical expression

Input:
Minterms of the expression
  Written in the file ./minterm;
  LF follows every number;
  each number when transferred into binary, i.e. (q_n q_n-1 ... q_1 q_0), represents the minterm A_i (if q_i == 1) or  A_i'(if q_i == 0);
  NOTICE THAT THERE IS A 'LF' AFTER THE LAST NUMBER;

Don't-know terms of the expression
  Written in the file ./dontknow;
  the rest are the same as minterms;

Output:
The symbolic expression of the simplest form;

Example

Input

The same as the current file;

Output

A = A2A3'+A0'A2'A3+A0A1'A3
